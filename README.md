# RealEstateHousePricePrediction
A project leveraging machine learning to predict house market prices for a Real Estate Investment Trust based on various features, aiding strategic investment decisions using regression modeling.

This project serves as my submission for a course conducted by IBM, focusing on predicting house market prices for a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) venturing into residential real estate. In the role of a Data Analyst, the objective is to craft a predictive model capable of estimating house prices using various features. The dataset encompasses attributes such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of floors, and other pertinent features. Leveraging data analysis, exploration, and machine learning techniques, the project endeavors to offer valuable insights for the REIT's investment decisions. The anticipated outcome aims to empower the trust in making informed choices when entering the residential real estate market, optimizing investment strategies, and maximizing returns. The project encompasses the building, training, and evaluation of a predictive model, contributing to enhanced decision-making processes in real estate investments.
