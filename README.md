# RealEstateHousePricePrediction
A project leveraging machine learning to predict house market prices for a Real Estate Investment Trust based on various features, aiding strategic investment decisions using regression modeling.

This project focuses on predicting house market prices for a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) interested in residential real estate. The goal is to develop a predictive model that can estimate house prices based on various features. The dataset includes attributes such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of floors, and other relevant features. By employing data analysis, exploration, and machine learning techniques, the project aims to provide valuable insights for the REIT's investment decisions. The outcome will assist the trust in making informed choices when entering the residential real estate market, optimizing investment strategies, and maximizing returns. The project involves building, training, and evaluating a predictive model to enhance decision-making processes in real estate investments.
